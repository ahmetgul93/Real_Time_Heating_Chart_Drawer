# Real_Time_Heating_Chart_Drawer
This is Embedded and Real Time Systems Course Project

Aim of the project is reading temprature from MAX31855 heating sensor by Stellaris LM4F and showing the result on 16x2 LCD.
There are also some extra futures in project
        1. LM4F sent temprature data to com port.
        2. I also wrote C# code in order to read temprature data from com port.
        3. C# program gets temprature data and add them to chart.
        4. Chart draws real time graph for heating value.
        5. C# program also write temprature/heating value and time to Microsoft Excel file at the same time.
        6. If user press button2 , LM4F uses ThermoCouple
        7. If user press button2 again , LM4F uses Junction
        8. LM4F has 3 leds on it and the leds changes their colour by value.
